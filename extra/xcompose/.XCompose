# Enabling compose key: <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ComposeKey>

# NOTE: IBus support for XCompose is incomplete – only 2-letter shortcuts are
#       supported, e.g. "<Multi_key> <z> <w> <j>" won't work. However, stacked
#       <Multi_key> works fine.

# defaults: /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose
